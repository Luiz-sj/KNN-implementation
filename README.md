# KNN-implementation

The goal of this project is to develop an algorithm that implements the KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors) machine learning model through a class using only the numpy library (methods and functions take pandas dataframe format as input and use the same formatting as the scikit-learn library).

The dataframe to be used as an example is the Titanic Kaggle competition (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data). Considerations and feature normalization have been carried out, and the methods used are shown below.
